# About
This folder contains data intended for intentionally insecure server testing, such as testing authentication with usernames, passwords, emails, etc.

Most of the files in this folder will be **unencrypted** examples of data, which may include:
- Plain text files (.txt)
- JSON files (.json)
- Spreadsheets (.csv)
- Possibly memory-mapped files (for better realtime read/write performance)
