# Server-side Player Data Folder

## About
Player data in this folder is **example data** that is used for testing and
debugging, which is why files are intentionally stored as plain text or JSON
rather than having any level of encryption.

Encyrypted player data files will be stored outside of the repository as JSON
files using unique token identifiers that map to users rather than storing
usernames/passwords.
